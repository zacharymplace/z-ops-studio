# Case Study 02 — Ramp System Governance & SOP Framework  
**Service Area:** Systems Governance / Access Controls / Finance Ops  
**Industry:** Multi-Entity Healthcare / High-Volume AP

---

## 🎯 Overview  
The goal of this project was to design and implement a complete governance framework for Ramp — including SOPs, role structures, risk controls, and operational workflows — to ensure compliance, reduce errors, and scale processing capacity without sacrificing control.

---

## 📌 Problem  
Before the framework was introduced, the organization’s Ramp usage was fragmented:

- No standardized role design or permission tiers  
- Inconsistent cardholder controls  
- No unified SOP library across Treasury, AP, and Accounting  
- Card issuance lacked documentation and auditability  
- Access reviews were performed manually and inconsistently  
- No centralized logs for workflow automations  
- Lack of a governance structure to prevent policy drift  

This created risk exposure during audits, slowed operational throughput, and made cross-team processes unclear.

## 🚀 Solution — Z$ Ramp Governance Framework  
A full lifecycle governance system was built around these components:

### **1. Role Architecture & Permissions Matrix**  
- Defined 7 core user roles  
- Mapped each to least-privilege access  
- Standardized card creation rights  
- Codified vendor engagement boundaries  
- Introduced escalation logic for exceptions

### **2. SOP Suite (Treasury, AP, Accounting)**  
Each SOP included:
- Purpose, scope, and owner  
- Step-by-step process  
- Required system paths (Ramp, D365, GDrive)  
- Control checkpoints  
- Evidence collection requirements  
- SLA expectations  

Included SOPs:
- User Provisioning  
- Deprovisioning & Role Updates  
- Quarterly Access Review  
- Card Creation & Card Management  
- Workbook Maintenance  
- Integration Log Maintenance  

### **3. Integration Logs & Workflow Automation Structure**  
- Created `4_Integration_Logs` folder structure  
- Added naming conventions for all events  
- Introduced error-capture templates  
- Built rules for evidence retention  
- Standardized logs for audit use  

### **4. Governance Protocol Design**  
- Created the master Governance Protocol worksheet  
- Set quarterly review cadence  
- Assigned system owners + deputies  
- Documented change management pathways  
- Produced enhancement log processes  

### **5. Scalability Enhancements**  
- Folder structure for Templates vs. Live Data  
- SOP Mapping Index for global visibility  
- Training & reference hub  
- Role-based dashboards for process owners

## 📈 Outcomes  
The new governance system delivered measurable value:

- **100% audit-ready control environment**  
- **Clear least-privilege access for all users**  
- **Zero undocumented card**
