# Case Study 05 — Z$ Automation Lab: Finance Workflow Accelerator  
**Service Area:** Automation / Workflow Engineering / AI-Augmented Finance Ops  
**Industry:** Multi-Entity Healthcare / Finance & Accounting

---

## 🎯 Overview  
This initiative focused on identifying and automating high-friction finance workflows to reduce manual work, increase accuracy, and accelerate month-end and daily operational processes.

The goal was simple:  
Eliminate repetitive tasks so the finance team could operate at a higher strategic level.

---

## 📌 Problem  
Across Treasury, AP, Accounting, and FP&A, teams were losing significant time to manual, repetitive processes:

- Daily copy/paste workflows  
- Cross-sheet data validation steps  
- Reconciliation checklists built manually  
- Adaptive → Sheets → D365 sync processes  
- Vendor run-rate analyses requiring heavy formula work  
- Report distribution that wasn’t automated  
- Manual audit logs & change evidence  
- Inefficient training/onboarding due to system opacity  

These bottlenecks slowed decision-making, introduced risk, and pulled analysts away from higher-value work.

## 🚀 Solution — Z$ Finance Workflow Accelerator  
Built a suite of automations using Google Workspace, Sheets scripts, and lightweight Python utilities.

### **1. Daily Cash Position Automation**  
- Auto-pull of bank balances  
- Auto-calculation of variances  
- Daily blurb generator (SLA: < 2 minutes)  
- Optional push-to-email workflow  
- Reduced manual work from 45 minutes → 5 minutes

### **2. Report Distribution Bot**  
- Auto-export of core financial dashboards  
- Standard formatting layer  
- Auto-send to relevant stakeholders  
- Eliminated errors caused by manual distribution

### **3. Cross-Sheet Reconciliation Assistant**  
- Script to compare two large sheets  
- Flags mismatches in accounts, dates, line items  
- Generates color-coded exception sheet  
- Removed hours of manual checking

### **4. Vendor Run-Rate Model Automation**  
- Automated monthly calculation of vendor averages  
- Auto-applies inflation %, volume %, and occurrence floors  
- Pushes results into forecast_model  
- Prevented formula drift and user errors

### **5. Adaptive → Sheets Sync Utility**  
- Pulled Adaptive data into Sheets daily  
- Ensured FP&A always viewed the correct version  
- Created stable “single source of truth”

### **6. Audit Log Generator**  
- Automated change evidence capture  
- Timestamps actions  
- Stores results in GDrive  
- Enabled smoother external audits
