# Case Study 03 — Workday Adaptive Planning: Reporting & Model Optimization  
**Service Area:** FP&A Systems / Planning Models / Reporting Architecture  
**Industry:** Healthcare / Multi-Entity

---

## 🎯 Overview  
This project centered on improving the reporting and structural integrity of Workday Adaptive Planning. The organization struggled with visibility into expenses, lack of actionable reporting, and inefficient model structures that slowed planning cycles.  
The goal: create clarity, speed, and executive-ready reporting.

---

## 📌 Problem  
Before the optimization, the Adaptive environment had several pain points:

- Inconsistent account mappings  
- Models built with mixed logic and outdated structures  
- Broken report dependencies  
- Manual Excel workarounds outside the system  
- Lack of version discipline  
- Metrics buried under poorly organized account hierarchies  
- No standardized reporting package for leadership  
- Confusion between D365 data and Adaptive data views  

This led to delays in budgeting, inaccurate forecasts, and limited trust in the numbers.

## 🚀 Solution — Z$ Adaptive Reporting & Model Optimization  
The solution was a top-to-bottom rebuild focusing on architecture, clarity, and usability.

### **1. Model Cleanup & Structural Alignment**
- Rebuilt account hierarchies  
- Standardized all dimensions (accounts, departments, entities)  
- Ensured alignment with Dynamics 365  
- Removed dead logic and obsolete structures  
- Introduced clear naming conventions  

### **2. Reporting Package Rebuild**  
Delivered a suite of structured, CFO-ready reports:

- Department spend report  
- Headcount & payroll analysis  
- Forecast vs. Actual variance reports  
- GL-level drillable detail  
- Summary dashboards with top-level metrics  
- Driver-based assumptions reports  

Each report included filters for:  
Entity → Department → Account → Version → Time

### **3. Version Strategy & Governance**  
- Introduced version naming conventions  
- Created permissions around who can modify what  
- Established version “freeze” rules  
- Documented a clear forecasting cycle  

### **4. Dynamic Drivers & Assumptions**  
- Built logic for volume, inflation, and run-rate drivers  
- Moved miscellaneous assumptions into centralized driver sheets  
- Standardized cross-model references  
- Reduced dependency errors across modules  

### **5. Documentation & Process Guides**  
- Built a master “Adaptive Reporting Guide”  
- Added SOPs for monthly, quarterly, and annual processes  
- Provided a model architecture map for onboarding  
- Created training notes for analysts and managers

## 📈 Outcomes  
The optimization produced significant improvements:

- **70% faster reporting cycle**  
- **Zero Excel workarounds after rebuild**  
- **Improved leadership trust in metrics**  
- **Accurate alignment with D365**  
- **Clear governance & version discipline**  
- **Streamlined forecasting assumptions across models**  
- **Better visibility into spend drivers**  

Overall, the system became a strategic planning asset instead of a maintenance burden.
