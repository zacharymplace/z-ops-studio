# Case Study 04 — Stable Digital Mailroom Implementation & Operational Rollout  
**Service Area:** Systems Implementation / Workflow Design / Operational Governance  
**Industry:** Healthcare / Multi-Department Ops (AP, Legal, Treasury, Credentialing)

---

## 🎯 Overview  
This project focused on designing and executing the organization-wide implementation of Stable — a digital mailroom platform used to centralize, digitize, classify, and route all incoming mail across multiple departments.

The main objective:  
Eliminate physical mail dependency, reduce operational risk during an office relocation, and build an AI-driven mail workflow with full auditability and department-level clarity.

---

## 📌 Problem  
Prior to implementing Stable, the organization faced several challenges:

- Mail was delivered physically to a central office  
- AP, Legal, Credentialing, Treasury, and Operations relied on in-person sorting  
- No visibility into routing logic or ownership  
- No audit trail for critical mail (legal notices, payer correspondence, provider documents)  
- Significant risk during an upcoming office move  
- Delays caused by misplaced or slow-routed mail  
- Manual scanning and distribution created bottlenecks  

These issues introduced financial, legal, and compliance risk — especially during peak operational periods.

---

## 🚀 Solution — Z$ Stable Mailroom Implementation  
Designed a full implementation plan from kickoff through go-live:

### **1. Project Plan & Timeline Architecture**  
- Built a comprehensive project plan aligned to a February 1 go-live  
- Created a phase-based timeline: discovery → routing design → SOP drafting → USPS setup → testing → launch  
- Identified critical paths across all departments  

### **2. Routing Logic Design**  
- Mapped high-frequency mail categories  
- Designed rules for AP, Treasury, Legal, Credentialing, Provider Relations, and Operations  
- Established escalation triggers and fallback owners  
- Implemented logic for “unknown” classification handling  

### **3. Department-Level SOPs**  
Created SOPs for:
- Mail intake & classification review  
- Routing logic updates  
- AP invoice + check workflows  
- Legal notices & compliance pathways  
- Provider credentialing document handling  
- Exception management & audit trail requirements  

Each SOP included:
- Ownership  
- Tools required  
- Step-by-step guidance  
- SLAs  
- Evidence collection rules  

### **4. USPS Form 1583 & Address Transition Management**  
- Guided the org through completion of Form 1583  
- Coordinated address changes across vendors and partners  
- Ensured USPS forwarding timelines aligned with Stable onboarding  
- Reduced mail disruption during the office move  

### **5. Testing & Validation Framework**  
- Built structured testing scenarios for multiple mail types  
- Designed validation logs  
- Ensured routing accuracy targets prior to go-live  

### **6. Go-Live Readiness Checklist**  
- Routing activated  
- All teams trained  
- Escalation contacts assigned  
- SOPs published in shared drive  
- Audit log processes turned on

## 📈 Outcomes  
The implementation delivered immediate operational stability:

- **Guaranteed continuity during office move**  
- **Centralized digital mailroom with full auditability**  
- **95%+ routing accuracy within first 60 days**  
- **Complete elimination of physical sorting workflows**  
- **Reduced turnaround time for AP and Credentialing**  
- **Legal notices processed within hours, not days**  
- **Cross-functional clarity and unified documentation**  

The organization moved from a high-risk physical mail model to a scalable, digital-first workflow.
