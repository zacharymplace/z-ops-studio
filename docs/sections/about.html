  <p>
    Z$ Ops Studio is a one-person systems and automation studio designed to bring structure and high-performance workflows to modern teams.
    The focus is simple: create clarity, reduce friction, and elevate the way organizations operate.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What Z$ Ops Studio Does</h2>
  <p>
    The studio works across Finance Ops, Systems Architecture, Automation Engineering, and Creative Operational Design.
    Every solution is built with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clean structure</li>
    <li>Minimal friction</li>
    <li>Strong governance</li>
    <li>Real-world practicality</li>
    <li>Documentation built to last</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Approach</h2>
  <p>Z$ Ops Studio designs systems that are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Understandable</strong> — clear logic, clean structure</li>
    <li><strong>Maintainable</strong> — built so teams can own them</li>
    <li><strong>Scalable</strong> — ready to expand without breaking</li>
    <li><strong>Operational</strong> — designed for real workflows, not theory</li>
    <li><strong>Human-centered</strong> — built to make work feel lighter and more efficient</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="philosophy">
    The philosophy is simple:<br>
    <strong>Good systems multiply the value of the people who use them.</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>Why It Works</h2>
  <p>
    Z$ Ops Studio specializes in the space between:
  </p>
  <p><strong>Finance ←→ Systems ←→ Automation ←→ Creative Problem Solving</strong></p>

  <p>
    Most teams operate in one or two of these lanes.<br>
    Very few can bridge all four.<br>
    <strong>That’s the value.</strong>
